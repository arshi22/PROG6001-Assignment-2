# Git Collaboration Exercise

This Git repository is created for a collaborative exercise where group members will simulate a workflow to create, modify, and merge a repository using Git. This exercise is designed to mimic a real-world collaborative project among team members.

## Group Members
- Harinder Kaur (Student number 24135850)
- Andre Schubert (Student number 24096465)
- Syeda Anjum (Student Number 23229422)

## Task Details

### Step 1: Repository Creation
- Andre Schubert will create the initial Git repository and a document in it.

### Step 2: Fork and Modify
- Harinder Kaur and Syeda Anjum will fork the repository to create their own copies.
- Each team member will make distinct changes to their versions of the document. This can include adding new content or modifying existing content.

### Step 3: Commit and Push
- After making changes, each team member should commit their changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Push the updates to their respective forks on GitHub.

### Step 4: Create Pull Request
- Each team member will create a pull request from their forked repository to the original repository.
- Ensure that the pull request includes documentation of the task with screenshots. This documentation should cover the initial forking, the commit history with messages, and the pull request itself.

### Step 5: Merge Changes
- Andre Schubert, as the repository owner, will review the pull requests and merge the changes into the main codebase.

## Documentation
Each team member should document their tasks with screenshots to showcase the workflow. This documentation should include:
- Screenshots of the initial forking process.
- Screenshots of the commit history with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Screenshots of the pull request creation.
- Screenshots of the final merge into the main codebase.

Let's get started and collaborate effectively using Git!
